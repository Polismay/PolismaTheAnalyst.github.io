									</p> Executive Vice President of Zicklin Graduate Accounting Society <em></em>

									<h2> Work Experience</h2>
									<p> <b>Ncheng LLP: </b> <i> Staff Accountant</i> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <i>Mar 2022 - Current</i> </p>
									<p> 
										I have successfully managed accounting functions for multiple entities, taking charge of accounts payable, cashflow, and payroll to uphold internal control integrity and accuracy. 
										One of my notable achievements includes orchestrating a remarkable 50% reduction in processing time and costs by streamlining payroll processes for a client with over 400 employees. 
										My adaptability and quick mastery of office suites and accounting software resulted in a swift promotion to senior-level responsibilities within just three months. Specializing in nonprofit accounting,
										 I have collaborated with organizations with annual revenues ranging from $5M to over $30M, providing tailored financial solutions for their success.
									<p> <b> Dixon Hughes Goodman: </b> <i> Staff Accountant </i> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; <i>Sept 2021 - Mar 2022</i> </p>
									<p> I have developed a comprehensive understanding of substantive audit practices by actively supporting senior team members in executing low-risk audit procedures and handling entry-level tasks.
										 Additionally, I executed office etiquette while contributing to departmental administrative responsibilities, such as file management and client record updates, adhering to established standards. 
										 My role included assisting audit staff in conducting detailed reviews of designated organizational and functional activities to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of management controls. 
										 Notably, I played a key role in achieving surge goals during busy seasons by leveraging technologies like Excel to enhance overall efficiency.</p>

									<p> <b> BYUI- Transfer Evaluation: </b> <i> Processor</i> &nbsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <i> Oct 2019 - Sept 2021</i> </p>
									<p> I played a vital role in assisting the unit in surpassing surge goals by efficiently processing and transferring over 120 transcripts each week. 
										In addition to this, I actively participated in various seminars, acquiring valuable skills such as problem-solving, presentation, social, and 
										leadership skills. Furthermore, I cultivated a disciplined approach, consistently seeking the 'whys' behind any task and paying meticulous attention to detail in my work.</p>

										<p> <b> Excellent Business Consultant: </b> <i> Accounting Assistant</i> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <i> April 2019 - Sept 2019</i> </p>
										<p>Skillfully managing financial records, I ensured the accuracy of statements and successfully retrieved two years' worth of books, thereby enhancing financial transparency and strengthening reporting integrity within the organization. Demonstrating efficient multitasking, I collaborated seamlessly with the tax and payroll teams while concurrently handling bookkeeping, reconciliations, and various office responsibilities. My commitment to delivering outstanding customer support had a tangible impact,
											 reflected in the notable boost of reviews from 3.8 to an impressive 4.5. This achievement underscored my proficiency in effective verbal and written communication, showcasing my dedication to excellence across all aspects of my professional role.</p>
